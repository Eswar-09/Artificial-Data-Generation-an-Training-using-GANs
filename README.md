# Artificial-Data-Generation-an-Training-using-GANs
This project aims to develop a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to generate an artificial dataset using the available dataset cited below. This GAN will be used to generate artificial DATA by using pre-existing dataset. A large dataset is created by concatenating all the data.

# Requirments 
  * Python 3.8 or higher 
  * Numpy 
  * Keras 
  * Pandas 
  * TensorFlow
  * Matplotlib
  * Scikit-learn
  
# Usage 
   1.Clone the repository.
   2.Install the required libraries
   3.Pre-process the dataset to generate a training dataset using MATLAB and save it as train.csv
    (Run the Data_generation.m file).
    4.Train the GAN model
    5.Generate artificial DATA and save them as test.csv.
